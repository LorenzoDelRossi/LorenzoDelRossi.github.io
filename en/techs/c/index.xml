      <description>In the world of industry 4.0 each component must always be connected with the external world, and the component connected par excellence is the IOT node. My work involved the creation of an application for detecting environmental data (temperature, pressure and humidity) through the sensors installed on the node itself, with data processing for estimating the perceived temperature (Heat Index). To better synchronize the tasks I used various features of the FreeRTOS real-time operating system.</description>

      <description>Within complex systems consisting of multiple interconnected devices, a connection is required, both physically and logically, with a Master device (which is very often a microcontroller board). To allow all Slave devices to work correctly and in parallel, a communication protocol must be implemented, being careful to write it ad-hoc for each device to avoid interference in data transmission when the system is operating. My job was to adapt from C ++ language to C language a communication interface via I2C protocol for a distance sensor to be installed on an intubated propeller drone equipped with a Renesas RX63N microcontroller board.</description>
